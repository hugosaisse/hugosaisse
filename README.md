## Hi there, I'm Hugo Mentzingen (a.k.a. Hugo Silva) 👋

### 🌱 I'm a Communications Engineer, Data Scientist, AI Researcher, and Startup Co-Founder!

---

With over 15 years of rich experience in IT management and software engineering,
I've journeyed through multiple domains, gaining significant expertise as I went.
I pride myself on being the youngest and longest-lasting CTO of the Brazilian Insurance Supervisor (2014-2019),
managing to blend technology and leadership adeptly.

In 2019, I took a leap towards my passion for data science and artificial intelligence,
pursuing a Master's degree at Nova IMS.
The same year, I co-founded Arteh, a climate-tech startup based in Australia.
Our mission is to help businesses track their carbon emissions, simulate emission reduction scenarios,
and set science-based emission reduction targets.

Between 2021 and 2022, I learned as an adjunct lecturer at Nova IMS for the courses Data Science for Marketing,
Business Cases with Data Science, and Data Mining Descriptive Methods.

While embarking on these endeavors, I'm also engaged in a Ph.D. Program at Nova IMS,
primarily researching natural language processing (NLP), Machine Learning,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to the legal sector.
I use AI to identify legal precedents and put them in context. 

## 🔭 Current Projects

In my current role, I lead the implementation of the Policy Registration System in the Brazilian insurance market.
This novel system is set to revolutionize the industry by keeping records of all insurance transactions in Brazil,
already having recorded billions of unique events.

I'm writing a paper on the use of named entity recognition (NER),
part-of-speech (PoS) tagging, and LLMs to summarize court decisions and compute similarity.

Arteh's platform is also undergoing substantial improvements to make it more intuitive and user-friendly.
