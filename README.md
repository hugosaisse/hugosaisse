I build and operationalize intelligent systems at the intersection of **Generative AI, Machine Learning, legal practice, regulation, finance, and climate-tech**.  
Over a decade of experience turning AI into production value‚Äîleading strategic engineering organizations, founding startups, and publishing in top-tier venues.  

Currently, I‚Äôm driving GenAI adoption in financial services while researching language models for legal precedent retrieval and explanation.

## üî≠ Current Focus

### Lead Specialist, Deloitte Portugal (Mar 2024 ‚Äì Today)  
I architect and lead GenAI & ML solutions for tier-1 banks across Portugal and the Netherlands.  
Key themes: LLMs (prompt engineering, RAG, multimodal), AI Agents, document intelligence, virtual assistants, operational risk reduction, and knowledge automation.  
Featured outcomes include large-scale conversational assistants, automated document generation/classification, business process assurance, and contract data extraction.

### Ph.D. Candidate & Researcher, Nova IMS  
Researching **NLP, Machine Learning, and GenAI** applied to legal practice‚Äîespecially automated retrieval, summarization, and similarity of legal precedents.  
Developing pipelines combining textual and metadata signals to surface and contextualize decisions for administrative courts.

### Adjunct Lecturer, Nova IMS (Sep 2021‚ÄìJul 2022)  
Delivered practical classes for:  
- Business Cases with Data Science  
- Data Science for Marketing  
- Data Mining Descriptive Methods  

## üöÄ Recent / Ongoing Projects

- Designing and deploying **GenAI knowledge systems and virtual assistants** for banking clients, reducing support load and improving decision insights.  
- Researching and prototyping **legal decision summarization and precedent similarity** using NER, PoS tagging, embeddings, and LLMs.  
- Continuously evolving Arteh‚Äôs climate-risk platform (legacy work) and integrating learnings into explainable, scalable SaaS architectures.
